; Main Arc lib.  Ported to Scheme version Jul 06.

; don't like names of conswhen and consif

; need better way of generating strings; too many calls to string
;  maybe strings with escape char for evaluation
; make foo~bar equiv of foo:~bar (in expand-ssyntax)
; add sigs of ops defined in ac.scm
; get hold of error types within arc
; does macex have to be defined in scheme instead of using def below?
; write disp, read, write in arc
; could I get all of macros up into arc.arc?
; warn when shadow a global name
; some simple regexp/parsing plan

; compromises in this implementation: 
; no objs in code
;  (mac testlit args (listtab args)) breaks when called
; separate string type
;  (= (cdr (cdr str)) "foo") couldn't work because no way to get str tail
;  not sure this is a mistake; strings may be subtly different from 
;  lists of chars

; any logical reason I can't say (push x (if foo y z)) ?
;   eval would have to always ret 2 things, the val and where it came from
; idea: implicit tables of tables; setf empty field, becomes table
;   or should setf on a table just take n args?

; idea: use constants in functional position for currying?
;       (1 foo) would mean (fn args (apply foo 1 args))
; another solution would be to declare certain symbols curryable, and 
;  if > was, >_10 would mean [> _ 10]
;  or just say what the hell and make _ ssyntax for currying
; idea: make >10 ssyntax for [> _ 10]
; solution to the "problem" of improper lists: allow any atom as a list
;  terminator, not just nil.  means list recursion should terminate on 
;  atom rather than nil, (def empty (x) (or (atom x) (is x "")))
; table should be able to take an optional initial-value.  handle in sref.
; warn about code of form (if (= )) -- probably mean is
; warn when a fn has a parm that's already defined as a macro.
;   (def foo (after) (after))
; idea: a fn (nothing) that returns a special gensym which is ignored
;  by map, so can use map in cases when don't want all the vals
; idea: anaph macro so instead of (aand x y) say (anaph and x y)
; idea: foo.bar!baz as an abbrev for (foo bar 'baz)
;  or something a bit more semantic?
; could uniq be (def uniq () (annotate 'symbol (list 'u))) again?
; idea: use x- for (car x) and -x for (cdr x)  (but what about math -?)
; idea: get rid of strings and just use symbols
; could a string be (#\a #\b . "") ?
; better err msg when , outside of a bq
; idea: parameter (p foo) means in body foo is (pair arg)
; idea: make ('string x) equiv to (coerce x 'string) ?  or isa?
;   quoted atoms in car valuable unused semantic space
; idea: if (defun foo (x y) ...), make (foo 1) return (fn (y) (foo 1 y))
;   probably would lead to lots of errors when call with missing args
;   but would be really dense with . notation, (foo.1 2)
; or use special ssyntax for currying: (foo@1 2)
; remember, can also double; could use foo::bar to mean something
; wild idea: inline defs for repetitive code
;  same args as fn you're in
; variant of compose where first fn only applied to first arg?
;  (> (len x) y)  means (>+len x y)
; use ssyntax underscore for a var?
;  foo_bar means [foo _ bar]
;  what does foo:_:bar mean?
; matchcase
; idea: atable that binds it to table, assumes input is a list
; crazy that finding the top 100 nos takes so long:
;  (let bb (n-of 1000 (rand 50)) (time10 (bestn 100 > bb)))
